# Project 4: Arithmetic Practice Upgrade
An Android app for an arithmetic practice game, for C323 Android Mobile Development.
It has 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
It has 4 operations: Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Multiplication.
Instead of going to a 3rd screen, it now returns to the first screen with results.
It also has a Toast notification and a sound after submitting each answer.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can choose a difficulty
* [ ] User can choose an operation type
* [ ] User can choose the number of questions
* [ ] User can enter and submit their answer to each question
* [ ] User sees a Toast notification indicating correct or incorrect after each question
* [ ] User can hear a sound based on if their answer was correct or incorrect


The following **extensions** are implemented:

* I added some code so that the user could do decimal math for division, but left it commented out for now.

## Notes

Getting the arguments to hold default values was difficult because you have to explicitly set them, which I didn't know at first.
